  {"Q: Why our App need to ask for your location (GPS)? It is safe?": "A:Because our app use Bluetooth function, and this is abided by the Framework Agreement of Android and iOS. Any Bluetooth app must request location permission. Our application won't ask and use your WLAN/Celluar, so turn on the location just because the Android and iOS's rule. We are unable see and receive your location."},
  {"Q：What is the PIN code? Why can’t connect to the APP?": "A：You can't connect devices on your phone's system via PIN. App download and use requires acceptance of location terms. Connection method is to open the device first, then open the \"Grill 5.0\" App on the phone, search through the search page, click \"hcitool scan\", and search for \"Grill BT5.0\" in a few seconds, click to enter use."},
  {"Q:Why not wireless?": "A：Wireless refers to the Bluetooth connection between the device and the phone, not the connection between the probe and the device. This has the advantage of not having to stare at the temperature display of the device all the time."},
  {"Q：Why always disconnect the Bluetooth connection?": "A：The product uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology with Bluetooth 5.0 module (TI‘s CC2640). In an open and unobstructed environment, it can reach a distance of 70 meters; but it does not penetrate the wall well. The characteristic of this Bluetooth technology is that as long as the device is connected, no matter the signal strength, it can be used normally."},
  {"Q:LLL on the display": "A: Temperature exceeds range: 33℉~572℉（1℃~300℃）or the probe is damaged"},
  {"Q: Why does the display keep flashing after setting the temperature range?": "A: Only when the current temperature is between the temperature range, the display can return to normal. If it is lower or higher than the temperature range, the device and mobile phone will alarm with the flashing display."},
  {"Q:Why no data is displayed after power on?": "A: If the probe is not plugged into the socket after powering on, the device will not display temperature and auto power off after 3 minutes."},
  {"Q：How to convert ℉":
    "A:\n1. Open \"BF Home\" and click Temperature Start\n2.Click \"三\" in the upper right corner for more\n3.Click on \"Setting\"\n4. Click \"Temperature unit\"\n5. Tap Celsius to convert to Fahrenheit."

    {"Q: When the BF-30/40 and the smart device are paired successfully, can I close the APP during cooking/grilling?": "A:Do not close the APP, simply minimize it ensure the alarm will alert you when the temperature reaches the target temperature"},
    {"Q: If the BFour thermometer have already been paired with smart device, do I need to re-pair them when I use the them again?": "A:No, if you've paired, it will automatically connect when you open the APP and remove the probe from the booster."},
    {"Q: If I go out of range, how do I reconnect my smart device to the thermometer?": "A:The signal will reconnect automatically with your smart device once your smart device is back within range."},
    {"Q: Can I use the thermometer in the microwave ?": "A:No , you can't use your thermometer in the microwave."},
    {"Q: How should I disarm the booster's alarm sound?": "A:\n(1) When the booster reaches the target temperature, the booster will sound an alarm, and the alarm can be stopped by pressing the power button.\n(2) When the booster and the probe are disconnected,the booster will sound an alarm and the alarm can be stopped by pressing the power button twice.\n(3) When the booster temperature is out of temperature range to avoid probe damage, the booster will keep sounding the alarm until the temperature is in the normal range (32℉-212℉ /0℃-100℃)."},
    {"Q: What should I do if no data is displayed after powering on?": "A: If the temperature is not displayed upon powering on, it may be due to the probe not being plugged into the socket properly. In such cases, you can reinsert the probe into the socket and remove it again to ensure proper display of the temperature."},
    {"Q:Why can't it charge?": "A: Please check if the charging spring of the probe slot is loose, if it is loose, please contact us!"},

    {"Q: Why does the supercharger sound an alarm and how do I disarm it?": "A:\n(1) When the probe reaches the target temperature, the booster will sound an alarm and can be disarmed by pressing the power button.\n(2) When the booster is disconnected from the probe, the booster will sound an alarm, press the power button twice to disarm the alarm.\n(3) When the probe is out of temperature range, the booster will sound an alarm until the temperature drops."},
    {"Q:How is a cooking temperature graph created and stored?": "A:After you select the meat type and doneness and press Start \"Start Cooking\" button, the APP will record the internal temperature of the meat and create a temperature graph that you can save at any time.When an alarm is issued when the set temperature is reached, the temperature graph will be automatically saved to the history alarm record."},
    {"Q: The temperature doesn't seem to be accurate?": "A: \nIf your thermometer probes are giving an inaccurate reading, we recommend our customers to conduct an \"Ice Bath Test\" for accuracy. \nThermometer accuracy is ± 1 ° C / 1.8 ° F\nBelow:\n1) Fill a glass or cup to the top with ice. \n2) Add pre-chilled / cold water to just below the top of the ice. Stir for about 15 seconds. \n3) Insert the thermometer probe into the center of the ice bath.\n4) Let it sit for another 15 seconds. Keep the probe sensor surrounded by the ice water and moving constantly. "},
    {"Q:How to set probe?": "A:Here are steps to set probe as follows:\n1、Open the APP and connect the device.\n2, Click more \"三\" in the upper right corner of the temperature display page;\n3、Click \"Set Probe\";\n3、Select the \"black probe\" or \"white probe\" to be added.\n4, the list will show the temperature of the new probe, click on it will show \"Probe Setting Success\".\n5、After the probe is added successfully, the booster will display the current temperature of the probe.\nAttention:\nPlease put the new probe into boiling or ice water to distinguish the temperature from other probes to avoid confusion."},
    {"Q:Why is the probe out of range or no temperature display?": "A:If the booster display is out of range, it is likely that the probe is too far from the booster or the probe is damaged.\n1. Place the probe as close to the booster.\n2、Make sure the probe is charging in the booster for 2 minutes, the display will show \"fully charged\".\n3、Try to re-add the probe to connect to the booster in APP.\n4、When using the probe, please make sure that the probe is inserted deeply into the meat so that the groove on the probe is completely covered. The internal temperature of the probe must not exceed 212°F/100°C. Failure to do so will result in damage to the probe and make it impossible to read the temperature.\nIf none of the above solves the problem, the probe is damaged, please contact us."},
